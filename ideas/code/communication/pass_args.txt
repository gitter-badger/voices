# Passing arguments to already running application

## Memory Mapped File
1. try to get lock on lockfile
  * if succeeded, launch normally
  * if not, go to step 2
2. open memory mapped file at location
  * aquire write lock (using ReadWriteLock)
    * if not possible, wait some time and try again...
    * after x seconds, just terminate without passing arguments 
  * write down arguments in file
  * release write lock for other application instances
  * close connection to file
  * quit application

3. running application checks for modification of file 
  * if modified, reads all bytes into byte array and parses arguments (--variable_name=value)
    * sets all variables to newer values
  * deletes all content of file so length equals 0
